this is a landing page project that i am working on to improve my skills and enhance what i have learned so far. i will start off by building the html foundation and add style later on. I will add more details here as i go along all the way until i finish the project.

I have created the html document and set the foundation for my landing page. will add more content as i go along. 

I have decided to dedicate my landing page to exploration of the Universe. I have added images of stars, galaxies,etc.. as well links for more exploration if desired. I have created a style.css file with different styles and layouts and linked it to my html file to give my landing page a nice look.

All the links and references used on my landing page are as follow:

- Logo - created from https://Logomakr.com/app
- Images - all images are from https://www.pexels.com/search/universe/
- Learn more - first "learn more" link leads to https://astronony.com
- Learn more - second "learn more" link leads to https://www.universe-of-learning.org/learners-families
